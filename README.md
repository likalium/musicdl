# MusicDL
(i didnt have orignal ideas for the name)
___

This is a bash wrapper for [OrpheusDL](https://github.com/OrfiTeam/OrpheusDL) and [Streamrip](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip). I love these two projects (go give them stars) but I wanted to add some features (easily adding multiple albums to download, automatically load/unload the python virtual environment...), and also to have a hub that let me use the two of them easily: that's why this project exists.

## TODO
- [ ] Actually finishing it
- [ ] Make a python version for better compatiblity with windows
